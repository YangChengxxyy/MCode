//! `HookRunner` defines the agent loop's hook dispatch points.
//!
//! The production runner currently has no installed hooks. Tests can install a
//! tool-call gate to verify argument rebinding and blocked dispatch.
//!
//! The three dispatch semantics (pi's model):
//!
//! * [`notify`](HookRunner::notify) — fire-and-forget broadcast.
//! * [`transform`](HookRunner::transform) — middleware chain: value in,
//!   possibly rewritten value out.
//! * [`gate`](HookRunner::gate) — may rewrite the payload in place and/or
//!   block the action ([`GateResult::Block`]).
