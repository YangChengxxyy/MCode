//! Secures the eager owned-home directory bootstrap.
//!
//! The module creates only the owned root and `plugins/`. Existing ancestors
//! outside the owned boundary may be followed, while the owned root and child
//! are opened or created relative to a trusted ancestor without following
//! links. Platform implementations verify
//! ownership, apply private access control, and durably publish newly created
//! directories. Crate-private owned-file machinery adds bounded reads,
//! persistent locks, and handle-relative atomic replacement without defining
//! any document schema.
